# /10dev — Orchestrator Entry Point

Environment manager and onboarding orchestrator for 10 Development Rules. Does NOT own any state files. Detects current state, guides the user, then delegates to existing skills.

## Flow Router

```
ONBOARDED=no?
  → Phase 1 (welcome) → Phase 2 (CLAUDE.md) → Phase 3 (project scan) → Phase 4 (launch skill)
  → touch ~/.10dev/.onboarded

ONBOARDED=yes, PROJECT_10DEV=no?
  → Phase 3 (project scan) → Phase 4 (launch skill)

ONBOARDED=yes, PROJECT_10DEV=yes?
  → Phase 5 (dashboard)

Subcommand "/10dev setup"?
  → rm ~/.10dev/.onboarded → restart from Phase 1

Subcommand "/10dev status"?
  → Phase 5 (dashboard) regardless of state
```

## Phase 1: Welcome (runs once globally)

```
10 DEVELOPMENT RULES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

A Claude Code agent skill. 10 rules as active decision gates.

Workflow: plan → exec → review → distill
          scope → build → audit → learn

Commands:
  /10plan    Scope boundaries, contracts, stages, failure paths
  /10exec    Staged execution + isolation + self-correction
  /10review  10-rule audit (SHIP / BLOCK verdict)
  /10distill Extract principles + evolve developer profile
  /10docs    Document health + Obsidian vault sync
  /10profile View/manage your blind spot profile
  /10dev     This command — environment + status

Typical first session: /10plan → /10exec → /10review → /10distill
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

No configuration questions. Welcome is informational only. Proceed to Phase 2.

## Phase 2: CLAUDE.md Routing Injection

**Condition:** `ROUTING=no` AND `ROUTING_DECLINED=no`

Ask:

```
10dev can add routing rules to this project's CLAUDE.md.
Effect: say "help me plan this feature" → auto-triggers /10plan.

A) Add routing rules (recommended)
B) No thanks, I'll type /10xxx commands manually
```

**If A:**
1. Create CLAUDE.md if it doesn't exist.
2. Check idempotency: `grep -q "## Skill routing — 10dev" CLAUDE.md`. If found, skip.
3. Append routing + behavior block:

```markdown

## Skill routing — 10dev

When the user's request matches a 10dev mode, invoke the corresponding skill
as your FIRST action. Do NOT answer directly.

- "plan", "scope", "design", "start a task" → invoke 10plan
- "build", "implement", "execute", "code this" → invoke 10exec
- "review", "audit", "check", "PR review" → invoke 10review
- "distill", "retro", "what did we learn" → invoke 10distill
- "sync docs", "doc health", "clean up docs" → invoke 10docs
- "my profile", "blind spots" → invoke 10profile
- "10dev", "status" → invoke ten-dev-rules

## Agent behavior — 10dev

1. Think before acting. Read existing files before writing code.
2. Be concise in output but thorough in reasoning.
3. Prefer editing over rewriting whole files.
4. Do not re-read files you have already read.
5. Test your code before declaring done.
6. No sycophantic openers or closing fluff.
7. Keep solutions simple and direct.
8. User instructions always override this file.
```

4. Tell the user: "Routing rules added to CLAUDE.md. You can commit it when ready: `git add CLAUDE.md && git commit -m 'chore: add 10dev routing rules'`"

Do NOT auto-commit. The user controls when to commit project files.

**If B:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.10dev
touch ~/.10dev/.routing_declined
```

---

## Phase 3: Project Scan

**Condition:** `PROJECT_10DEV=no` (project hasn't used 10dev before)

### Step 1: Lightweight scan

```bash
_PROJECT_NAME=$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)")
_COMMIT_COUNT=$(git rev-list --count HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
_LAST_COMMIT=$(git log --oneline -1 2>/dev/null || echo "none")
_HAS_README=$([ -f README.md ] && echo "✓" || echo "✗")
_HAS_CLAUDE_MD=$([ -f CLAUDE.md ] && echo "✓" || echo "✗")
```

Display:

```
New project detected: {name}
Branch: {branch} | Commits: {N} | Last: {last commit}

Docs: README {✓/✗}  CLAUDE.md {✓/✗}  todo.md {✓/✗}  lessons.md {✓/✗}
Profile: {✓ N blind spots / ✗ not created yet}
```

### Step 2: Read context (lightweight)

Read existing docs to understand the project (agent reads, does not display raw content):
- `README.md` (first 100 lines, if exists)
- `CLAUDE.md` (if exists)
- `git log --oneline -10`

Generate a one-line project summary: "This appears to be a {type} that {does what}."

### Step 3: Create .10dev/

```bash
mkdir -p .10dev
```

That's it. No boundary.txt, no lessons.md, no projects.txt registration. Each skill creates its own state when the user actually uses it.

---

## Phase 4: Launch First Skill

Ask:

```
Environment ready. What would you like to do first?

A) /10plan — Plan a new feature (creates boundary, contracts, stages)
B) /10review — Audit recent code changes against 10 rules
C) /10distill — Extract lessons from completed work (creates developer profile)
D) Explore on my own — don't launch anything
```

**If A/B/C:** Read the corresponding skill's SKILL.md from `{10DEV_ROOT}/skills/{choice}/SKILL.md` and execute it inline. Skip the chosen skill's preamble sections that /10dev already handled (state detection, project context).

**If D:** Display available commands and exit.

---

## Phase 5: Dashboard

**Condition:** `ONBOARDED=yes` AND `PROJECT_10DEV=yes`

Run status detection:

```bash
# Count todo items
_TODO_PENDING=0; _TODO_DONE=0
if [ -f todo.md ]; then
  _TODO_PENDING=$(grep -c '^\- \[ \]' todo.md 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
  _TODO_DONE=$(grep -c '^\- \[x\]' todo.md 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
fi

# Count lessons
_LESSON_COUNT=0
[ -f lessons.md ] && _LESSON_COUNT=$(grep -c '^### \|^- \*\*' lessons.md 2>/dev/null || echo "0")

# Count boundary paths
_BOUNDARY_COUNT=0
[ -f .10dev/boundary.txt ] && _BOUNDARY_COUNT=$(wc -l < .10dev/boundary.txt | tr -d ' ')

# Count profile blind spots
_BLIND_SPOTS=0
[ -f ~/.10dev/developer-profile.md ] && _BLIND_SPOTS=$(grep -c '^\- \*\*' ~/.10dev/developer-profile.md 2>/dev/null || echo "0")

# Count principles
_PRINCIPLES=0
[ -f ~/.10dev/universal-principles.md ] && _PRINCIPLES=$(grep -c '^\- \|^### ' ~/.10dev/universal-principles.md 2>/dev/null || echo "0")

# Count registered projects
_REG_PROJECTS=0
[ -f ~/.10dev/projects.txt ] && _REG_PROJECTS=$(wc -l < ~/.10dev/projects.txt | tr -d ' ')
```

Display:

```
10 DEV RULES: STATUS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Project: {name} | Branch: {branch}

Local:
  .10dev/boundary.txt   {✓ N paths / ✗ not set}
  .10dev/contract.md    {✓ frozen / ✗ not set}
  todo.md               {✓ N pending, N done / ✗ not created}
  lessons.md            {✓ N entries / ✗ not created}

Global:
  Developer profile     {✓ N blind spots / ✗ not created}
  Projects registered   {N}
  Universal principles  {✓ N / ✗ none yet}

CLAUDE.md routing       {✓ active / ✗ not configured}
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Smart suggestion** based on state:
- boundary ✗ + todo ✗ → "Suggestion: run /10plan to scope your next task."
- todo has all items done → "Suggestion: run /10review then /10distill."
- lessons ✓ but profile ✗ → "Suggestion: run /10distill to create your developer profile."
- Everything ✓ → "All set. Run /10plan when you're ready for the next task."
